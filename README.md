# Emergent Cognition Framework

This repository explores human insight, creativity, and intuition as emergent, non-algorithmic processes.  
It integrates stochastic memory recombination with dominance-weighted causal projection to explain how humans generate novel reasoning, anticipate key drivers, and achieve intuitive understanding.

ðŸ“„ **Full Proposal:** [Proposal.md](./Proposal.md)

## Objective
To model and emulate human-like non-algorithmic cognition in artificial systems without relying on quantum computation or exotic mechanisms â€” capturing intuition-driven foresight in complex, multi-actor systems.

## Core Features
- Memory and dormant pattern storage  
- Stochastic / probabilistic exploration  
- Contextual integration and relevance detection  
- Dominance-weighted causal projection  

## Applications
- AI systems with intuition-like reasoning  
- Cognitive modeling of insight and creativity  
- Neuroscience studies on emergent cognition  

## How to Use
1. Read [Proposal.md](./Proposal.md) for the full theoretical framework.  
2. Build conceptual or AI models following its hypotheses.  
3. Contribute refinements or empirical tests.
