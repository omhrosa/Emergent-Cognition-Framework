## Description
A biologically grounded framework explaining **emergent, non-algorithmic cognition and insight** through memory recombination, stochastic exploration, and contextual integration.

This framework provides a simple, elegant, and testable explanation for how the brain generates insight, creativity, and aspects of consciousness **without invoking speculative quantum mechanisms**.

---

## Overview
The central idea:  
1. The brain maintains **dormant memories and patterns**.  
2. Neural stochasticity allows **novel recombinations** of these patterns.  
3. Relevant external stimuli are integrated, producing **emergent insight or conscious experience**.  

This mechanism explains “aha” moments and non-algorithmic cognition in a **classically plausible, biologically grounded way**.

## Future Directions
- Neuroscience validation: test spontaneous neural activity correlations with insight emergence.  
- AI modeling: implement classical systems with memory, stochastic recombination, and relevance detection.  
- Refinement: explore integration mechanisms and probabilistic exploration in both biological and artificial systems.
