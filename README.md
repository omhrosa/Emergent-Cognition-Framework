# Emergent Cognition Framework

A framework for modeling human insight, creativity, and intuition as emergent algorithmic processes.  
It integrates memory recombination, stochastic exploration, contextual relevance evaluation, and dominance-weighted causal projection — offering a roadmap for AI systems capable of intuition-like reasoning.

## 🎯 Objective
To model and emulate human-like insight and intuition through algorithmic means — without requiring quantum or non-computable processes.  
The framework bridges neuroscience and AI by defining cognition as an emergent property of interacting algorithmic modules.

## ⚙️ Core Components
* **Memory & Dormant Pattern Storage** — Repository of latent experiences and concepts.  
* **Stochastic Exploration** — Randomized recombination generating novel associations.  
* **Contextual Integration** — Dynamic filtering for coherence and relevance.  
* **Dominance-Weighted Causal Projection** — Identification of primary drivers across complex causal networks.

## 🧠 Potential Applications
* Cognitive architectures for creative and intuitive AI  
* Computational modeling of insight and foresight  
* Cross-domain reasoning systems with contextual adaptability  
* Neuroscience-inspired learning frameworks
