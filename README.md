Emergent Non-Algorithmic Cognition Framework

This repository contains the proposal and theoretical framework for understanding human insight, creativity, and intuition as emergent, non-algorithmic processes. It integrates stochastic memory recombination with dominance-weighted causal projection to explain how humans generate novel reasoning, anticipate key drivers in complex systems, and achieve intuitive understanding.

Structure

README.md - Overview of the project, objectives, and structure.

Objective

To model and potentially emulate human-like non-algorithmic cognition in artificial systems without relying on quantum computation or exotic mechanisms, while accounting for intuition-driven foresight in multi-actor complex systems.

Key Features

Memory and dormant pattern storage

Stochastic/probabilistic exploration

Contextual integration and relevance detection

Dominance-weighted causal projection

Potential Applications

AI systems capable of intuition-like reasoning

Cognitive modeling of insight and creativity

Neuroscience research on emergent cognition

How to Use

Review Proposal.md for the detailed theoretical framework.

Conceptual models and AI implementations can be built following the hypotheses and mechanistic features described.

Contributions and refinements are encouraged to test and expand the framework.
